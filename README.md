# Predicting Titanic Survival Rate
In this jupyter notebook, We have tried to build a simple LogisticRegression model to predict survival rate from Titanic dataset.

## Prepare the dataset
In ML, at first we prepare the dataset. Here we replace the missing values with 'NaN', and drop unnecessary predictive features/variables.

## Data Exploration
To build, train and develop a ML model, the most important part is to analyse the dataset.
